# Deezer Top 50 Songs Tracker

This project tracks the top 50 most listened songs daily and weekly on Deezer for each country.

## How does it work?

The main Python script parses a music listening log file, calculates the listening count for each song in each country, and writes the top 50 songs for each country into a file. It also calculates the weekly top 50 songs for each country, based on the daily top 50 files from the previous seven days.

Two executables are provided to make using this project easier:

1. **Deezer Top 50 Tracker.exe**: This is the main executable. When run, it finds the most recent listening log file in the same directory, parses the data, and writes the top 50 files for each country. It also writes the weekly top 50 files.

2. **Delete Files.exe**: This executable deletes all the files generated by the main executable. It is useful if you want to delete all data and start fresh.

## How to use it?

1. Ensure you have the music listening log files in the same directory as the executables. These files should be in .txt format and contain a line for each song listening. Each line should be formatted as: `sng_id|user_id|country`.

2. Run **Deezer Top 50 Tracker.exe**. This will generate the top 50 files for each country in the `country_top50_logs` directory, and the weekly top 50 files in the `weekly_country_top50_logs` directory.

3. If you want to delete all generated files, run **Delete Files.exe**. This will delete the `country_top50_logs` and `weekly_country_top50_logs` directories, along with all the files they contain.

## Notes

- Be careful when using **Delete Files.exe**, as file deletion is irreversible.
- If you encounter any issues, check that the listening log files are correctly formatted and the executables have permission to read and write files in their directory.
